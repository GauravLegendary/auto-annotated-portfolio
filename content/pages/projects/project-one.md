description: "Campfire Teleport is a custom Minecraft plugin designed to intelligently teleport players based on their respawn status. If a player has a bed (respawn point) set, the plugin safely teleports them to a random location near their bed, ensuring they stay close to their base. If no bed is found, it defaults to a random teleport (RTP) behavior, offering a survival-friendly way to explore the world.\U0001F527 Key Features:✅ Detects player’s respawn point and teleports nearby\U0001F30D RTP fallback for players without a bed\U0001F6CF️ Supports survival gameplay and server immersion⚙️ Lightweight and performance-optimizedThis was my first custom plugin, and it taught me how to work with player data, location handling, and condition-based teleportation.

**Campfire Teleport** is a unique Minecraft plugin designed to provide players with a more immersive and intuitive teleportation system. Instead of relying on commands or items, players can simply interact with a glowing campfire to trigger a return journey. If they’ve already set a bed spawn point, the plugin will teleport them close to their bed, ensuring a seamless return to familiar ground. For those without a set spawn, it intelligently finds a safe random location in the world, allowing players to continue their adventure without the frustration of getting lost or stuck.

This plugin is perfect for survival, RPG, and SMP-style servers where immersion and gameplay experience matter. It ties naturally into the existing Minecraft mechanics, making campfires more than just a source of light or cooking. With smart teleport logic that avoids dangerous zones like lava or caves, Campfire Teleport ensures that players arrive safely and enjoy a smooth, lore-friendly experience. The idea behind the plugin is to blend gameplay with world-building—making travel feel magical, earned, and in sync with the game’s atmosphere.

As a future-ready plugin, Campfire Teleport is designed for expansion. Planned features include visual effects, cooldowns, particle customization, permissions support, and even server-wide configuration options. Whether you're building an epic RPG world or running a small survival server with friends, this plugin gives you a new tool to elevate the player experience. It's simple, immersive, and built with care—just how Minecraft plugins should be.
