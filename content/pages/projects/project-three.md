**ParkourX** is a feature-rich parkour plugin designed to bring smooth, competitive gameplay to Minecraft servers. Whether you’re running a minigame network, survival hub, or an RPG map, ParkourX allows you to build courses with checkpoints, timed runs, and rewards for completions — all with stunning visual feedback and lag-free performance.

Players can start courses using signs or commands, and their progress is automatically tracked using real-time checkpoints. The plugin features built-in holographic leaderboards, firework victory effects, and session-based timers — perfect for those speedrun moments or server-wide competitions.

Built with performance and customization in mind, ParkourX gives server admins powerful tools to adjust course difficulty, region settings, and reward logic. It also includes placeholders, GUI support, and permission-based access for events or rank-based challenges. Whether casual or competitive, ParkourX makes parkour exciting again.
